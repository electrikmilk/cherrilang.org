# Documentation

Welcome to the Cherri programming language documentation!

Thanks for taking an interest in the Cherri programming language. Cherri is designed to be easy to learn and use and it's likely very similar to a programming language you are already familiar with.

Contributing to this open-source documentation is more than welcome as while most
things work, bugs, or inaccurate documentation are likely.
